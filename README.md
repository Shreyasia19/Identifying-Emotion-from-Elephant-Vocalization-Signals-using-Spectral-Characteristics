# Identifying-Emotion-from-Elephant-Vocalization-Signals-using-Spectral-Characteristics
Overview
This project focuses on the classification of elephant vocalizations into behavioral contexts using machine learning techniques. With the increasing threats to elephant populations due to habitat encroachment, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict, there's a pressing need for scalable and efficient wildlife monitoring systems. Manual analysis of acoustic data is resource-intensive and impractical at large scales. This repository presents a supervised learning pipeline to automate the interpretation of elephant calls using spectral features.

🔍 Problem Statement
Understanding and classifying elephant calls can provide critical insight into their behavior and environment. However, traditional manual methods for analyzing acoustic data are not scalable for real-time conservation efforts.

✅ Objectives
Automate the classification of elephant vocalizations based on their spectral features.

Evaluate and compare multiple machine learning models for multi-class classification.

Address data imbalance using oversampling techniques.

Align the work with UN Sustainable Development Goal 15: Life on Land.

📁 Dataset
File used: 20231225_dfall_obs_data_and_spectral_features_revision1_n469.csv
